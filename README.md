## Project Proposal 1:
--------------------------------
### Doctor’s Office Application:  - APPROVED 
Commnets: I am expecting you would implement NLP (speech to text and vice versa) to the mobile app that would enable EHR and sync information.

##### Problem: 
At the doctor’s clinic, the patients have to fill out a numbereous number of forms before getting treated. This gives much stress to patients as well as staff to handle medical documents and also becomes a bottleneck for in treatment process. With pen and paper process it is hard for doctor to keep track of patients. Also, the patient may be an elderly person who may have trouble filling up so many forms by writing all the details. It may also be one who is not old but is in pain and going through the elaborate process of writing everything down adds to the woes. 

##### Solution: 
We plan to implement an interactive system which will help the patients to fill out all the forms by giving answers verbally to the questions that are being asked. Also system keeps records of medical treatment for future access to doctor and patient.


## Project Proposal 2:
--------------------------------

### Fraud Awareness

##### Problem: 
There has been increase in frauds taking place in United States. Many people are unaware of such frauds happening. Due to unawareness about such frauds many people fall in such traps. If people are made aware of such occurances frauds happening can be reduced. 

##### Solution: 
To develop a platform where people can post about fraud faced by them. When any fraud is posted, system will send notification to registered users and police department. Also unresgistered users can also view frauds list whenever they want. System can also filter frauds based on location, type of frauds, category of people targeted. 

## Project Proposal 3:
--------------------------------
### Medicine Alarm

##### Problem:
Taking medicines on time and regularly is main key for getting recovery. Many times people forget consuming medicines on time resulting in degrading health conditions. Espically older people tend to forget taking thier medicines. Many times there are people who donot like to take medicines and skip thier medicnies. It is hard for thier family members to keep track weather they had medicine or not. 

##### Solution:
Our proposal is to develop a system which triggers alarms in the devices of the patients as well as added
family members, nurse, doctors of the patients till he/she takes the required medication. An IOT based project which works by
sensing the touch of the medicine organizer to send notifications in the connected devices.
