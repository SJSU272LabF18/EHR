### Medicine Alarm

##### Problem:
Taking medicines on time and regularly is main key for getting recovery. Many times people forget consuming medicines on time resulting in degrading health conditions. Espically older people tend to forget taking thier medicines. Many times there are people who donot like to take medicines and skip thier medicnies. It is hard for thier family members to keep track weather they had medicine or not. 

##### Solution:
Our proposal is to develop a system which triggers alarms in the devices of the patients as well as added
family members, nurse, doctors of the patients till he/she takes the required medication. An IOT based project which works by
sensing the touch of the medicine organizer to send notifications in the connected devices.

### Fraud Awareness

##### Problem: 
There has been increase in frauds taking place in United States. Many people are unaware of such frauds happening. Due to unawareness about such frauds many people fall in such traps. If people are made aware of such occurances frauds happening can be reduced. 

##### Solution: 
To develop a platform where people can post about fraud faced by them. When any fraud is posted, system will send notification to registered users and police department. Also unresgistered users can also view frauds list whenever they want. System can also filter frauds based on location, type of frauds, category of people targeted.
