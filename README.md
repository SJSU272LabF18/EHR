## Project Proposal 1:
--------------------------------
### Doctor’s Office Application:  - APPROVED 
Commnets: I am expecting you would implement NLP (speech to text and vice versa) to the mobile app that would enable EHR and sync information.

##### Problem: 
At the doctor’s clinic, the patients have to fill out a numbereous number of forms before getting treated. This gives much stress to patients as well as staff to handle medical documents and also becomes a bottleneck for in treatment process. With pen and paper process it is hard for doctor to keep track of patients. Also, the patient may be an elderly person who may have trouble filling up so many forms by writing all the details. It may also be one who is not old but is in pain and going through the elaborate process of writing everything down adds to the woes. 

##### Solution: 
We plan to implement an interactive system which will help the patients to fill out all the forms by giving answers verbally to the questions that are being asked. Also system keeps records of medical treatment for future access to doctor and patient.
